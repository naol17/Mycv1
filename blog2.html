        <h2>Emphasis Element(em)</h2>
        <p> It is a relative measurement</p>
        <p>It is the difficult value to wrap because it is difficult to to control the context as we want. Like when we want to use different text size or other like image this em is are use for any any other length to size them so 1em size is 16px so if
            we want like to 2em or 3em it is going to be bold out and overlapping on each other can occur</p>
        <p>In case of zooming this method good to do zoom able sites because the element in 1em takes the full content or the 16px as we bumps up the everything will become larger means when the size of the 1em is becoming larger as we said the element in
            the container will take the full size so that the to fit the container the elements also become larger and zooming will be occurs .</p>
        <p>In this case it is good but what if we add some contents in that container another time in this case is the thing what we are adding is larger than the previous one our previous view will be destroyed and it will fit the size of the new container
            size and this is the back draw of em.</p>
        <h2>% The percent Method</h2>
        <p>
            It measure relative to the percent length it measure as the container size or capacity if it is wide it use the material size or if it is smaller material it takes the instrument length it acts as the condition.
        </p>
        <p>In case of zooming the thing we discussed in em also appears her due to as we mentioned it takes the mentioned present for the sizing as we zoom in and zoom out it fits the mentioned size of the container. For the time being it seems good if one
            day we conclude another thing larger in size that the previous now the length of the container will be change and the mentioned percent for the previous content will not fit </p>
        <p>fit Now so fix that it take the mentioned percent of the new length in that case the layout we want become different form the previous so this method is good in case of creating zoom able site but if we change something we should remember that
            the lay out also will be changed from as.</p>

        <h2>Relative Emphasis Element(rem)</h2>
        <p>it is similar with that of the em what makes different is while em is related to the container it contend in gut this is always relative to the root html element </p>
        <p>This means first if we define the root container size and then we can put all elements by comparing to the root size it always measure the inside elements compared to the mother or the root container.</p>
        <p>In case of zooming this is more preferable than the above two method as we discussed it use relative to the root size it increase and decrees with the parent size if we zoom in and zoom out it increase with parent size.</p>
        <p>And another time if we add a new element in the container even if it is larger than the previous element due to the size of the container is relative to the parent container it takes the previous size it is already specified the size of the container
            and the new element also takes the size r the container in this case there will not be disordered container size.</p>

        <p>When we mean by 200px when the default px is 16</p>
        <p>
            This is mean that it uses the 200px of the 16 meaning that it uses as a ratio taking the 16 px as default then from that it will calculate the 200 px of the browser means it calculates relative t the browser default pixle this 16 px is the entire browser
            pixel but when we say 200px it takes the each and individual em in the browser container it calculate every em f the browser it o not take as a general width or length
        </p>
        <p>And we are mentioning the container or the elements size comparing to the parent size</p>
        <p>When we calculate this as we mentions the bass px is 16 it calculates every points and one point is 0.75px then 1px = 1.33pt hence 24px is equivalent to 1.33 * 24 = 32px so in this case it changes the px to points and try to interpret the mentioned
            width length to concise with our desired length </p>

        <h3>Answer 6</h3>
        <p>The biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 is now split into different sections called modules </p>
        <p>this process to what happened with CSS2, where everything was submitted as a single document with all the cascading style sheet information within it but in css3 each of the modules is being worked on <br>CSS3 offers several new ways to write
            CSS rules with new CSS selectors, as well as a new combinatory, and some new pseudo-elements.
        </p>
        <h2>There are three new attribute selectors</h2>
        <li> Attribute beginning matches exactly</li>
        <li>Attribute ending matches exactly</li>
        <li>Attribute contains the match</li>
        <h2>New properties</h2>
        <p>create visual styles that would likely associate more with a graphics program In CSS3, the box model hasn't changed. But there are a bunch of new style properties that can help us style the backgrounds and borders of your boxes.
        </p>
        <p>There are also some new background properties in CSS3:</p>
        <li>background-clip
            <p id="ri">This property defines how the background image should be clipped. The default is the border box, but it can be changed to the padding box or the content box.</p>
        </li>
        <li> background-origin
            <p id="ri"> This property determines whether the background should be placed in the padding box, the border box, or the content box.</p>
        </li>
        <li>background-size
            <p id="ri"> This property indicates the size of the background image. It allows you to stretch smaller images to fit the page.</p>
        </li>
        <h2>Changes to Existing Background Style Properties</h2>
        <p>There are also a few changes to existing background style properties:</p>
        <li> background-repeat
            <p id="ri"> There are two new values for this propertyâ€”space and round. Space spaces the tiled image evenly within the box without being clipped. Round rescales the background image so that it will tile a whole number of times in the box.</p>
        </li>
        <li> background-attachment
            <p id="ri"> A new value is added so that the background will scroll with the element's content when that element has a scroll bar.</p>
        </li>
        <li> background
            <p id="ri"> The background shorthand property adds in the size and origin properties.</p>
        </li>
        <h2>New Border Style Properties</h2>
        <li> border-radius
            <p id="ri"> border-top-right-radius, border-bottom-right-radius, border-bottom-left-radius, border-top-left-radius
                <br> These properties allow you to create rounded corners on your borders.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>border-image-slice
            <p id="ri"> Represents the inward offsets from the border image edges.</p>
        </li>
        <li> border-image-outset
            <p id="ri"> Specifies the amount that the border image area extends beyond the border box.</p>
        </li>
        <li> border-image
            <p id="ri"> The shorthand property for all the border image properties.</p>
        </li>
        <p>Using css3 developer can add text shadow to make it easier to read they can also add visual effects to break lines and longer words so that they fit properly inside columns and word wrap And can change the color and size of text
        </p>
        <p>Empty target elements that do not have text or children, like empty elements and it how css is gradually incrising its ability and faster performance brought css to the todays place </p>
